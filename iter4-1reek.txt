At the start of Iteration 4-1, we had 100 total warnings. 
30 of which were "IrresponsibleModule" warnings from controllers, models, test controllers and models, finally from migrate files.

We went in adding simple comments to the top of the ruby files to remove all of the "IrresponsibleModule" warnings. 
Thus leaving us with 70 total warnings left. The rest being duplicate code, "InstanceVariableAssumption",  "ToManyInstanceVariables", "Create"model"#change", and some warnings with the gems we are using.
We are planning on fixing all of these warnings when we refactor, that is all the ones we made - we will not be touching the warnings that are in a file that was created by gems.
